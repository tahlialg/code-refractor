## The Task

For this particular homework assignment, I had to assume that I was hired by a marketing agency to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

**Importance of Accessibility**
An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business; for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

**What I Learnt**
- Check that all links are functioning correctly. 
- Increase the efficiency of the CSS by:
    - Consolidating the selectors and properties.
    - Organising them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
    - Including comments before each element or section of the page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](first-hw-task-demo.png)

**Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. In the future, I would like to add responsive design to the webpage so that the web application is optimised for any screen size.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to download the project and deploy it to your local computer. your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. From the repository, click 'Code' button on the right side of the page.

2. Copy the clone command (either the SSH format or the HTTPS).

3. From a terminal window, use the `git clone` command with the URL of the Git repository.

4. In order to clone a git repository into a specific folder, execute the `git clone` command and specify the destination folder at the end: $ git clone <url> <directory>>

5. GitHub should deploy the repository to your local computer.

You can also refer to this [Cloning a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more guidance.
